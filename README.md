# Raspi
just little raspberry pi projects

## The purpose

Just a little repo that shows my progress in using a raspberry pi4 while documenting my projects

## What exactly do I own

Well not much of it since most of this was copied from various sources (especially the fancontrol.py file since it was my first crack at python)
